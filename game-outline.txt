Game should be like groundhog life, knight progression, or others in the vein.
Most excellent example would be Cavernous 2 (https://nucaranlaeg.github.io/incremental/CavernousII/)


This means timers for every object such that they level up over time, (example implemented with darkvision)

Story needs to be planned out more fully, including what kind of skills one would get
Stats needs to be decided on as well, should be made simpler than earlier, possibly just 4 stats?
